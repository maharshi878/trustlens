# TRUSTLENS — Digital Content Forensics Platform

## 🔍 **Digital Truth. Verified.**

*A next-generation platform built to verify the authenticity of photos, videos, receipts, screenshots, and documents in a world where manipulation is effortless.*

---

## 🚨 Why TrustLens Exists

Deepfakes, AI-generated content, fake UPI receipts, edited chats, synthetic videos — digital misinformation is now indistinguishable from reality.

> The world has tools to create fake content.
> **TrustLens is the tool that verifies it.**

---

## 🧠 What TrustLens Does

When a user uploads content, TrustLens runs multilayer forensic checks and returns:

* **Authenticity Score** — real, partially edited, or fully synthetic.
* **Anomaly Highlights** — pixel inconsistencies, compression jumps, font mismatches.
* **Reality Trace™** — reconstructs the most probable creation process.
* **TruthScore+™** — evaluates potential real-world risk.
* **Source Match Shield™** — template + web presence cross-check.
