# 🔍 TRUSTLENS  
### **Digital Content Forensics for Everyone**

**Detect. Verify. Trust.**  
A next-generation platform built to verify the authenticity of images, screenshots, videos, and digital documents in a world where manipulation is effortless.

## 🚨 Why TrustLens?

The line between *real* and *fake* has never been thinner.

AI tools like Sora, VEO, Midjourney, and Runway can generate hyper-realistic content.  
Fake UPI receipts, edited WhatsApp chats, AI-generated videos, and fabricated school notices are spreading faster than truth.

> **The world has tools to CREATE fake content — TrustLens is the tool that verifies it.**

## 🧠 What TrustLens Does

When a user uploads content, TrustLens produces:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **🧪 Authenticity Score** | Probability of content being real, edited, or fully generated. |
| **⚠️ Anomaly Highlights** | Detects pixel inconsistencies, UI spacing errors, AI fingerprints, and more. |
| **🧬 Reality Trace™** | Reconstructs how the content was likely created (camera → edit → screenshot → AI → export…). |
| **🛡 TruthScore+™** | Shows risk impact (financial/social/identity/reputation). |
| **🔁 Source Match Shield™** | Checks web presence, template matching, metadata, perceptual hash similarity. |

---

## ✨ Core Capability Highlights

- ✔ Image forensic analysis  
- ✔ Video frame-level consistency detection  
- ✔ Screenshot authenticity verification  
- ✔ Document & UPI receipt template matching  
- ✔ Deepfake + AI trace detection  
- ✔ Metadata & recompression signature analysis

## 🚀 Why TrustLens Is Different

Most tools answer:

> ❓ “Is this AI?”

TrustLens answers:

> 🧬 “How was this created?”
> ⚠️ “Can it cause harm?”
> 🛡 “Should it be trusted?”

TrustLens combines:

- Forensic image science  
- Computer vision  
- AI artifact detection  
- Context-aware rule systems  
- Creation-path reconstruction  
- Risk intelligence scoring  

No existing AI detectors do this.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- Students & teachers  
- Small businesses & sellers  
- Parents & communities  
- Investigators & journalists  
- Social media users  
- Anyone who wants certainty before sharing or believing content  

Manipulation affects **everyone** — TrustLens protects everyone.
