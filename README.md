## 🚨 Why TrustLens?

The line between *real* and *fake* has never been thinner.

AI tools like Sora, VEO, Midjourney, and Runway can generate hyper-realistic content.  
Fake UPI receipts, edited WhatsApp chats, AI-generated videos, and fabricated school notices are spreading faster than truth.

> **The world has tools to CREATE fake content — TrustLens is the tool that verifies it.**

## 🚀 Why TrustLens Is Different

Most tools answer:

> ❓ “Is this AI?”

TrustLens answers:

> 🧬 “How was this created?”
> ⚠️ “Can it cause harm?”
> 🛡 “Should it be trusted?”

TrustLens combines:

- Forensic image science  
- Computer vision  
- AI artifact detection  
- Context-aware rule systems  
- Creation-path reconstruction  
- Risk intelligence scoring  

No existing AI detectors do this.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- Students & teachers  
- Small businesses & sellers  
- Parents & communities  
- Investigators & journalists  
- Social media users  
- Anyone who wants certainty before sharing or believing content  

Manipulation affects **everyone** — TrustLens protects everyone.
